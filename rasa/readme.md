## To run PrimoPobre:

Use `rasa train` to train a model (this will take a significant amount of memory to train,
if you want to train it faster, try the training command with
`--augmentation 0`).

Then, to run, first set up your action server in one terminal window:
```bash
rasa run actions --actions actions.actions
```



In another window, run the bot:
```bash
rasa shell --debug
```

Note that `--debug` mode will produce a lot of output meant to help you understand how the bot is working 
under the hood. To simply talk to the bot, you can remove this flag.
